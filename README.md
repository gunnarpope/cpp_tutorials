# Simple C++ Tutorials
The following projects provide some examples of basic coding techniques in C++. The code is written with separate in a modular format (using header files and a myclass.cpp file that can be included into your main project (main.cpp).)

## To compile a project:
Navigate into a project's directory. Then compile and run the project using the following commands, as shown in the classes/ example.

```
~/repos/cpp_tutorials/classes $ c++ main.cpp myclass.cpp
~/repos/cpp_tutorials/classes $ chmod 770 a.out
~/repos/cpp_tutorials/classes $ ls
a.out  main.cpp  myclass.cpp  myclass.h  README.md
~/repos/cpp_tutorials/classes $ ./a.out

If you like these tutorials and coding in C++, think about becoming an blockchain developer on the [EOS.IO platform](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos). We're going to change the world with this technology and we would love for you to join the movement. I hope this helps :)
