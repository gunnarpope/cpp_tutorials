/*
""The this pointer points to the object that invoked pwr( ). Thus, this â€“>b refers to that
object's copy of b. For example, if pwr( ) had been invoked by x (as in x(4.0, 2)), then
this in the preceding statement would have been pointing to x. Writing the statement
without using this is really just shorthand.""
